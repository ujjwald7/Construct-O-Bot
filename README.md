# Construct-O-Bot
E-Yantra 2019-20 Final Code

Contains The Final Code Draft along with self-defined header files for a line following Construction Bot which traverses a path with varying obstacles such as,
a zig-zag path and wall-following using SHARP sensors in the absence of no line.

Also contains the code to control the Bot's arm for a Bi-directional pickup and place mechanism of construction materials.

A V-REP Simulation of the above code was also carried out before the hardware implementation of the same.
